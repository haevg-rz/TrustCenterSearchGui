# Intro:

An application to search and filter in a certificate store from a trust center

# Core routine:

1) First we get URLs from the user
2) The content will be downloaded
3) With the lokal data one can search keywords

This makes the search of specific certificats more comfortable.

We are createing a multifunctional framework for any TrustCenter.
