# TrustCenterSearchGui

![.NET Core](https://github.com/haevg-rz/TrustCenterSearchGui/workflows/.NET%20Core/badge.svg)

## Intro
This file is meant for developers. Users please see our Wiki(Link to wiki).

## Project Description
This project allows you to search and filter in a trust centerÂ´s certificate store.

## Prerequisites

You need the x509 Certificates you want to browse encoded in Base64 in a .txt file. Each Certificate has to be seperated by two "new Lines". You can either download this file in  the application using the "Download" button or by manually dragging the .txt file into the specified folder and update the config (see features).

## Features
  
### Download the file from an URL
Enter a valid url pointing to a file of the format described above. Enter a custom name describing the Trust Center you want to add and press the download Button.

The programm will download the file and save it in the appdata folder.

The exact path is:

C:\Users\LOCAL_USER\AppData\Roaming\TrustCenterSearch\data 
(make sure to exchange "LOCAL_USER" with you local windows user name ;) )

It will also write the trust Center to the config and display the added certificates.
  
### Manually adding certificates
If you want to add certificates manually, simply place the .txt file into this folder:

C:\Users\LOCAL_USER\AppData\Roaming\TrustCenterSearch\data
(again make sure to exchange "LOCAL_USER" with you local windows user name .. ;) )

and then update your config file.

You can do this either by opening the config file, situated in:

C:\Users\LOCAL_USER\AppData\Roaming\TrustCenterSearch\
(and again make sure to exchange "LOCAL_USER" with you local windows user name ... ;) )

the structure of the config is explained below (see Config)
  
### Trust Center History
   
##### Delete Trust Center 
removes the currently displayed certificates of that trust center, deletes the corresponding.txt file and removes the trust center from the config
##### Info about Trust Center
displays the url, name and the last date of downloading
##### Reload Trust Center
deletes the trust center and then downloads it from the given url
##### Add to Filter/ Remove from Filter
  
### Searching
You can search for any property of the certificates using the searchbar. Only the certificates matching the query will be displayed, the property in which the search term was found will be highlighted red.
